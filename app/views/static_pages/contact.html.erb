	<h4>Before Calling:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li> - Know what you want to order.</li><br>
		<li> -  Check the location you are calling. We are in Fremont and Ballard.</li>
		<li> - If the phone is busy, keep trying. There's only one phone and
        many callers.</li>
        <li> - Speak quickly and clearly. One person both answers the phone and
		manages the line.</li>
		<li>- Be specific. Ordering a "Carribean" can mean many things. "Carribean
		Roast Sandwich" is preferred.</li>
	</ul>
  <h4>When Arriving:</h4>
  <ul>
  	<li>If the line is long, skip it and come to the front, otherwise please wait.</li>
  	<li>Your order won't be called until paid for. Make sure we know you are here.</li>
  	<li>Remember we are cash only. Large orders have 10% gratuity added, but
		gratuity with every order is appreciated.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Catering:</h4>
	<p>Pricing and menu are the same, however if you want dinners to feed a
group, we'll put all the items separately in large containers for you
to set up as a buffet. Please give 48+ hours notice.</p>
