	<h4>Before Calling:</h4>
	<ul id="ordering-info">
		<li>Know what you want to order.</li>
		<li>Check the location you are calling: Fremont or Ballard.</li>
		<li>If the phone is busy, keep trying: There's only one phone and
        many callers.</li>
        <li>  Speak quickly and clearly: One person both answers the phone and
		manages the line.</li>
		<li> Be specific: Ordering a "Caribbean" can mean many things, "Caribbean
		Roast Sandwich" is preferred.</li>
	</ul>
  <h4>When Arriving:</h4>
  <ul id="ordering-info">
  	<li>If the line is long, skip it and come to the front, otherwise please wait.</li><br>
  	<li>Your order won't be called until paid for. Make sure we know you are here.</li><br>
  	<li>Remember we are cash only. Large orders have 10% gratuity added, but gratuity with every order is appreciated.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Catering:</h4>
	<p>Pricing and menu are the same, however if you want dinners to feed a
group, we'll put all the items separately in large containers for you
to set up as a buffet. Please give 48+ hours notice.</p>
